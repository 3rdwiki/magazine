Phalcon PHP Framework: A Quick Look

=============
Introduction
=============
PHP frameworks abound and usually there is nothing special about them.  At the
moment the flavour of the month seems to be Laravel but I recently got to play
with a new framework called Phalcon.  It's fast and easy to get off the ground.
Did I mention it is fast (we'll get to that later).  Currently as of writing
the stable release is 1.3.2 but it is still very actively being developed.

===========
The Basics
===========

Phalcon is a MVC framework much in the same line as Laravel.  It has some
striking similarities mostly through following best practices.
As you would expect it does a lot of heavy lifting for you and lets you just 
get on with coding.  Of course with the heavy lifing comes the ability to
extend the prebuilt classes and tweak the functionality just how you'd like.

==================
Under the Surface
==================
Now comes the fun bit and I've held it off the secret to this framewor more 
than long enough.  Phalcon is a C library that you install into PHP as an
extension.  "Say what?" I hear you say.  Yes that is right it installs as an
extension and is a compiled library.

"So what does that mean?" I also hear you say.  It means that it is quick.
Very quick.  Being compiled means the framework responds nice and quickly. It
also means some tricky installation.

You don't just download an archive file and extract it to a folder.  No some
cases you have to compile it on your machine and quite frankly that would have
scared me away if I had paid attention. Fortunately for me by the time I got
to the part about compiling it I was already intrigued enough to contunue.

After gettin over that the next problem I had was that my IDE of choice wasn't
able to use the extension to have all those lovely autocompletes.  However
that was also solved by getting the Developer Tools
(http://phalconphp.com/en/download/tools) and pointing it at the folder that
is included.
============
Handy Tools
============
For a start the documentation is simply brilliant.  It is nicely laid out and
clear.  This was what really got me interested in the first place.  If a
project has good documentation it shows that people really care about it.  So
much so that they are prepared to do good documentation in this case.  I
especially enjoyed the examples as, personally, I like to learn by seeing code.

As I mentioned the Developer Tools is also available.  It has some interesting
scaffolding tools to get you started.  However once you've used the scaffolding
you'll probably find that you will need to change quite a bit to get the code
that satisfies your requirements.
It does a good job getting you started though and, as it is pointed out, you 
will probably be making most things by hand once you have the hang of it.

Conclusion
===========
Good: Great documentation.  Easy to get a page up and running quickly.

The Bad: Hard to install for novices or those not too familiar with digging
around in a server.

Finally I must mention I will make is that the main author does do Google 
Hangouts from time to time.  If you do get into Phalcon I'd encourage you
to watch them and participate if you feel so inclined.  This is a person making
the effort to reach out to the community and that should always be encouraged.
